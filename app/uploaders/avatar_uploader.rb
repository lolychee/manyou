  # Choose what kind of storage to use for this uploader:
  # storage :file
  # storage :s3
  storage :grid_fs

  # Override the directory where uploaded files will be stored.
  # This is a sensible default for uploaders that are meant to be mounted:

  # Provide a default URL as a default if there hasn't been a file uploaded:

  # process :scale => [200, 300]
  #
  # def scale(width, height)
  #   # do something
  # end

  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  version :small do
    process :resize_to_fill => [16, 16]

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:

    %w(jpg jpeg gif png)

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  def filename
